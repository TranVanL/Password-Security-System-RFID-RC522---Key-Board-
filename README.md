Link Demo : 

Password-Security-System(RFID-RC522 and Key-Board) : 

In the project, we use RC522 to identify SD Card and Key-Board to enter PassWord.

The system will check if the SD Card is correct then give a buzzer signal and open the door if the card is correct.

Users can also enter PassWord to open the door and there is also a buzzer signal if it is correct or incorrect. If it is incorrect more than 5 times, there will be a penalty of waiting 60 seconds.

The door opening system here uses Servo motors.

Keyboard (PB8 -> PB15);

Good luck !!!
